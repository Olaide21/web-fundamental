HTML Document Structure and Elements
The provided HTML code defines a basic web page structure with various elements, including headings, paragraphs, images, audio, and video. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Document Type Declaration
<!DOCTYPE html>: This is the document type declaration, which tells the browser that the document is written in HTML5.
HTML Element
<html>: This is the root element of the HTML document, which contains all the other elements.
Head Element
<head>: This element contains metadata about the document, such as the title, charset, and links to external stylesheets or scripts.
<title>Document</title>: This sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser's title bar and in search engine results.
Body Element
<body>: This element contains the content of the HTML document.
Headings
<h3>About Hemdee.com</h3>: This is a third-level heading element, which displays the text in a larger font size.
<h1 style="color: red;">BABATUNDE MUIDEEN</h1>: This is a first-level heading element, which displays the text in a larger font size and red color.
Paragraphs
<p>...</p>: These are paragraph elements, which contain blocks of text. There are three paragraphs in total, each with multiple lines of text.
Line Breaks
<br>: These are line break elements, which create a new line in the text.
Span Element
<span style="color: red;">Viral Marketing Stars,</span>: This is a span element, which is used to apply styles to a section of text. In this case, it sets the text color to red.
Image Element
<img src="img20.jpg" alt="picture" style="width: 40%;">: This is an image element, which displays an image from the file img20.jpg. The alt attribute specifies alternative text for the image, and the style attribute sets the image width to 40%.
Audio Element
<audio controls=""><source src="DONO-MIND Remix x starry ace.mp3" type="audio/mp3"></audio>: This is an audio element, which plays an audio file from the source DONO-MIND Remix x starry ace.mp3. The controls attribute adds playback controls to the audio element.
Video Element
<video width="600" controls=""><source src="Romeo & Juliet (2021) (NetNaija.com).mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>: This is a video element, which plays a video file from the source Romeo & Juliet (2021) (NetNaija.com).mp4. The width attribute sets the video width to 600 pixels, and the controls attribute adds playback controls to the video element.
This HTML code creates a basic web page with headings, paragraphs, an image, audio, and video elements. However, it's worth noting that the code uses inline styles, which are not recommended for maintainability and scalability. It's better to use external stylesheets or CSS frameworks to manage the layout and design of the page.
